# FIFA Player Value Prediction Regression Model Comparison

## Overview ðŸ“Œ
This project predicts **FIFA male playersâ€™ market value** (in millions of euros) using multiple regression techniques.  
We compare:
- **Linear Regression (No Polynomial Features)**
- **Linear Regression (With Interaction & Polynomial Features)**
- **Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)**
- **Random Forest Regression**

The goal is to analyze which attributes most influence a playerâ€™s value, evaluate and compare model performance, and visualize the results.
